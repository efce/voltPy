==== General ====
- Guidelines on how to add new Analysis/Processing methods
- Separation of JavaScripts from py files / code cleanups
- Separation of HTML from py files / creation of HTML draw only functions
- Separation of CSS from all files (?)

====  UI/UX =====
- General improvements in UI (use boost?)
- More work on UX:
  - Group main menu items and create dropdown lists
  - Clear selection menu with Analysis methods
  - Clear selection menu with Processing methods
  - Ability to add method to favorites (ability to add star to the method like in gmail)
  - Menu with favorite and last used methods
  - Separate Copy (instant copy) and add CurveSet to selection in CurveSet creation
- Ability to share CurveSet/Analysis with other registered user (ro/rw)
- Sharing of curves/curvesets/analyses via link (ro/rw) -- which instantly displays the data without any login screen
- Create panel with user settings and privileges
- Ability to process selected curve as all in the CurveSet (required for calibration method)
- Dynamic adjustment of plot size based on client resolution/window size (?)

==== Programming =====
?- Debugging of Bokeh plot switching -- why the plot stay on screen after reload ?
- Own form superclass (?), with notifications after processing and automatic handling of bound/unboud forms
?- Classes instead of functions for views
- Protect JSON form NANs and INFs -- handle all values gracefully in python (override JsonResponse function?)

==== Functionalities ====
- Support for additional file formats and additional file/curve information:
  - Implement Autolab files parsing
- Additional processing/analysis methods:
  x splines - smoothing algorithm
  - wavelets - smoothing, and decomposition/calibration with zero-crossing method
  - Calibration method
  - ICM - Integrated Calibration Method
  - OSC - Orthogonal Signal Correction -- wip in branch osc
  - Estimation of Cell Time Constant (tau) based on ASD (capacitive factor) -- wip in master (kind of works)
  - Genetic algorithm for background correction -- Łukasz(?)
  - PLS - Partial Least Squares calibration -- Łukasz(?)
- Add comments section below, which can be used by all users with at least ro privilege
